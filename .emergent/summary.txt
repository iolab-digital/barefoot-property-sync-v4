The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the Barefoot Property Management WordPress plugin's API integration within a hybrid React/FastAPI environment. Initial challenges included an unresponsive admin interface due to JavaScript/AJAX issues and a persistent This is a Custom method error from the Barefoot SOAP API's  method. The engineer diligently debugged these, creating a FastAPI backend for direct API testing and a React frontend for UI validation. A critical discovery was correcting the Barefoot API endpoint ( to ) after network resolution issues. While the API connection is now successful, property retrieval still yields zero results, indicating either account configuration problems or method restrictions. The work concluded with the engineer preparing to explore alternative SOAP methods.

The primary objective is to develop a WordPress plugin for Barefoot Property Management to synchronize vacation rental properties via their SOAP API. This involves creating a  custom post type, associated taxonomies, and over 30 custom meta fields. The synchronization process requires using API methods like , , , and , authenticated with provided credentials (username: , password: , Barefoot Account: ). Frontend functionalities such as property listings, search, availability, and rate calculation are also essential.

Currently, the WordPress plugin structure is established, and the SOAP API connection has been successfully re-established after initial failures. Earlier  calls failed, returning This is a Custom method and . This led to a workaround using  for individual properties (IDs 1-10) in the WordPress plugin, though the primary  issue persists. The most recent focus involved fixing unresponsive Test Connection and Test Get Properties buttons in the WordPress admin interface, which was addressed by building a separate FastAPI/React test harness, revealing and fixing a critical API endpoint misconfiguration. The API now connects, but property retrieval still yields zero properties, with the  method returning This is a Custom method.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the property synchronization logic to parse and map all Barefoot property fields (e.g., , , , , ) for properties beyond the currently tested 1-20 ID range.
-   Implement batch processing and progress tracking for synchronization.
-   Develop frontend property listing pages, search, filter, availability checking, rate calculation, and quote creation.
-   Resolve the issue where the Barefoot account currently returns 0 properties, potentially by exploring alternative API methods or verifying account configuration.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the core API integration issues. After the user reported API tests failing and no properties being pulled despite  claiming success, the engineer established a FastAPI backend and React frontend for isolated API testing.

Key actions and discoveries:
1.  **FastAPI Backend Integration**: A new Python file, , was created to house the SOAP client (). This file includes  and  functions, leveraging the provided API credentials.
2.  **React Frontend Test Harness**: A new React component, , was developed and integrated into . This provides a user interface with Test Connection and Test Get Properties buttons, mirroring the WordPress admin functionality but in an isolated environment.
3.  **API Endpoint Correction**: Crucially, debugging revealed that the FastAPI backend could not resolve . A web search led to the correct Barefoot API endpoint: . This endpoint was then updated in  and displayed in .
4.  **Connection Success**: After correcting the endpoint and refining error handling in , the Test Connection button successfully connected to the Barefoot API.
5.  **Property Retrieval Failure**: Despite a successful connection, attempting Test Get Properties resulted in 0 properties found and the message , consistent with earlier observations.
6.  **Next Debugging Step**: The engineer confirmed the API credentials were correctly configured within  and then created  to comprehensively explore all available SOAP methods and alternative approaches for property retrieval, as  is not working as expected.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to use the newly created  script to explore all available SOAP API methods and parameters from the Barefoot WSDL to identify a working method for retrieving properties.
