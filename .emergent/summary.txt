The previous AI engineer tackled a WordPress plugin for Barefoot Property Management, built on an unexpected React/FastAPI base. Initially, PHP environment setup and numerous syntax errors plagued the development. The core challenge revolved around the Barefoot SOAP API's  method, which consistently returned This is a Custom method and . After much debugging, including WSDL analysis and trying alternative methods, it was determined that  might be restricted, but  (with individual IDs) worked, successfully retrieving properties 1-10. The  parameter was also corrected. The final phase involved preparing the plugin for GitHub, but the user reported that admin interface buttons (Test Connection, Test Get Properties) were unresponsive, indicating a JavaScript/AJAX issue. The engineer was in the process of debugging and fixing these frontend interaction problems when the trajectory concluded.

The goal is to develop a WordPress plugin to integrate with Barefoot Property Management's SOAP API, synchronizing vacation rental properties. The plugin will create a  custom post type with taxonomies and over 30 custom meta fields. Key API methods for synchronization include , , , and , requiring credentials (username: , password: , Barefoot Account/API version: ). Frontend features like property listings, search, availability, and rate calculation are also required.

Currently, the WordPress plugin structure is built, and a basic SOAP connection works. However, initial  calls failed due to incorrect data parsing and field name mismatches, showing This is a Custom method and . This was later refined to use  for individual properties (IDs 1-10) due to  restrictions. The latest issue is unresponsive Test Connection and Test Get Properties buttons in the admin interface, indicating a JavaScript/AJAX problem.

-   **WordPress Plugin Development:** Leveraging custom post types, taxonomies, meta fields, hooks, and AJAX.
-   **SOAP API Integration:** Consuming WSDL-defined services using PHP's .
-   **PHP Development:** Core language for plugin logic, environment compatibility (PHP 7.4+), and syntax.
-   **JavaScript/AJAX:** For dynamic frontend and admin panel interactions.
-   **Debugging:** Extensive use of , custom scripts, and WSDL analysis for API troubleshooting.

The application primarily exists as a WordPress plugin within  (later referred to as ).



-   ****: The main plugin entry point. It registers custom post types, taxonomies, and handles plugin activation/deactivation. It also enqueues scripts and styles and includes other core plugin classes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Fixed JavaScript quote escaping. Added PHP version and SOAP extension checks. Corrected definition of  constant. Updated to pass  containing  and nonce to admin JavaScript. Included .
-   ****: Manages all interactions with the Barefoot SOAP API, including  instantiation, authentication, and method calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Incorporated  as the  parameter. Modified  to use the  method for individual property IDs (1-20), instead of , due to API restrictions/behavior. Added authentication parameters (username, password, barefootAccount) to API calls.
-   ****: Handles fetching and synchronizing properties from the API to WordPress custom post types.
    -   **Changes Made**: Adapted to retrieve properties using the  method by iterating through a range of IDs (1-20). Enhanced debugging to log API responses and property data.
-   ****: Defines the WordPress admin interface for plugin settings and synchronization controls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added debugging statements to  and  functions to troubleshoot JavaScript/AJAX issues. Ensured correct button IDs for AJAX calls.
-   ****: Frontend JavaScript for the admin interface, handling AJAX calls for Test Connection and Test Get Properties buttons.
    -   **Changes Made**: Corrected usage of  instead of a globally assumed . Made event listeners more robust.
-   ****: Contains PHP functions that handle AJAX requests from the admin interface.
    -   **Changes Made**: Verified registration of AJAX handlers like  and .

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the property synchronization logic to correctly parse and map all Barefoot property fields (e.g., , , , , ) for properties beyond the currently tested 1-20 ID range.
-   Implement batch processing for large datasets during property sync.
-   Implement progress tracking for synchronization.
-   Develop frontend property listing pages, search, filter, availability checking, rate calculation, and quote creation (though responsive templates are in place, the dynamic logic needs building).
-   Address the current issue where Test Connection and Test Get Properties buttons in the admin interface are unresponsive.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user report: When I click Test Connection, or Test Get Properties NOTHING happens. This indicates a failure in the admin interface's JavaScript and AJAX functionality.

The engineer identified several potential issues:
1.  Mismatch in JavaScript variable  versus the correctly localized .
2.  Potential mismatches in button IDs between the HTML and JavaScript event listeners.
3.  Possible improper registration of AJAX handlers on the PHP backend.

To debug this, the engineer examined:
-    for client-side AJAX logic.
-    to verify how  is enqueued and if  and nonce are correctly localized.
-    to check the HTML structure and button IDs.
-    to confirm server-side AJAX handler registration.

Specific changes made include:
-   Editing  to ensure  and nonce are correctly passed to the admin JavaScript using .
-   Editing  to correctly reference  and adjust event listeners.
-   Adding debugging  statements directly to  within  and  functions to diagnose if the admin page is even loading correctly and if JavaScript is executing.

The trajectory ended while the AI engineer was adding these debugging statements to the sync page in .

<optional_next_step>
I will complete adding debugging to the admin sync page and then test the admin interface's JavaScript and AJAX functionality.
